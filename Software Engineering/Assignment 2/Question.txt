After completing the inception phase, it was determined that the entire project can be completed in a single iteration. For convenience, here is the project description.

A user wants to generate charts of different types and formats. The type of charts include bar charts and pie charts. The input data will be in XML or CSV (Comma-Separated Values) formats. There are also many output formats of the charts, including SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and jpeg.

As an example, a user may request to create a bar chart in SVG format from theirXML data.

For efficiency reasons, a user may request multiple charts and multiple output formats in a single request, e.g., a request for both a bar chart and a pie chartof the same data. In this case, it would allow the input data to be loaded onlyonce.

Utilizing the use cases from assignment 1, create a class diagram and sequence diagrams for the design phase of the entire project. Also, update the requirements artifacts (as needed) and provide a file CHANGES that lists and explains changes made to the requirements artifacts. For instance, you will need to flush out use-cases in the brief format into the Fowler/Fully-dressed format.
