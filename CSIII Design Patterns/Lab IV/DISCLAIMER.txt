I was trying to optimize memory for this lab so I decided on not using any extra containers except for those already
provided by the original code snippet.

With this in mind, I decided on performing string manipulations instead. So as I read the file, I used the fact that
fileName.isEqual(courseEnrolled) and attach the file name along with the student information. 

When it comes to finding dropouts and so forth, I just create substrings of this entire info in order to extract
the studentâ€™s full name for processing.

Granted this method has room for improving and probably not the best way to go about it but hey :)
