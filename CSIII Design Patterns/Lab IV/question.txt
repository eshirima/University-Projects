Last Name Roster

Lab Assignment

The project is due in one week: by the midnight on the day of the next lab. 
Make sure to include your name in comments of the source files.
Recode the roster(i.e. originalroster.cpp) example we studied in class such that the list of classes the student
is enrolled in is output next to student name.

The printed out list may be tab-separated. You may assume that the text file structure is: one name per line; 
the line contains a first name followed by last name separated by white space. 
Each student has exactly two names: first and last. The course name is the file name without the extension. 
The dropouts file is always the last file in the list and its name is always dropouts.txt

Here is an example of a printout:

All Students
first name   last name  courses enrolled 
Kathleen    Anderson CS1   CS3
Gerald   Edwards  CS1   CS2 CS3
Mary    Price    CS1
...
You may not use associative containers: only vectors and lists.

Hint: after compiling the mater list of enrolled students, use find() function of list container to check if
the student name is present in each roster.
